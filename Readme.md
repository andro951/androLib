androLib is a library mod created by andro951.  It doesn't add anything to the game by itself.

Used to handle the storage systems for bags and other forms of storage as well as other utility functions.

<size=16>**Want to make your own vacuum bag?**</size>
This mod is set up to allow other mod creators to easily create their own bags.  (Bags are compatible with Magic Storage)
If you would like to see what is required and what the bag would be like, check out the Vacuum Ore Bag mod.
It is possible to create the bags without a hard dependency on this mod with the Register Call() if desired.

I'm planning to create a text tutorial and potentially create a wiki for this mod.
If you would like to create a bag for your mod before then, look at the Vacuum Ore Bag mod for an example.  It only requires the 1 simple ModItem file and a Mod.Load() call.

Feel free to reach out if you would like help creating a bag for your mod or if you find any issues with this mod.

This mod is also set up to allow non-bag storage vacuum integration if desired.  That would require a more setup on the other creator's part, 
but I do it with Weapon Enchantment, so let me know if you would like to do something like that.
